# VoronoiLib
C# implementation of Fortune's Algorithm. Includes MonoGame example.
Unlike several implemenations of Fortune's Algorithm, this implementation guarantees O(n ln(n)) performance by way of a specialized Red Black Tree (Credit: Raymond Hill).

Implementation inspired by:
Ivan Kuckir's project (MIT) @ http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html
